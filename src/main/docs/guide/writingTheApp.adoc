Lets describe the microservices you are going to build through the tutorial.

* `bookcatalogue` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and isbn.

* `bookinventory` - It exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fullfil an order.  I uses a domain consisting of a stock level and isbn.

* `bookrecommendation` - It consumes previous services and exposes an endpoint which recommends book names which are in stock.

Initially we are going to hardcode the addresses where the different services are in the `bookcatalogue` service.

As shown in the previous image, the `bookcatalogue` hardcodes references to its collaborators.

In the second part of this tutorial we are going to use a discovery service.

o learn about registration patterns:

We will use a **self‑registration pattern**. Thus, each service instance is responsible for registering and
deregistering itself with the service registry.
Also, if required, a service instance sends heartbeat requests to prevent its registration from expiring.

Services register when they start up:

We will use **client‑side service discovery**, clients query the service registry,
select an available instance, and make a request.
