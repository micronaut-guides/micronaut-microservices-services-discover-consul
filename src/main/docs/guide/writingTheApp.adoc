* `bookcatalogue` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and isbn.

* `bookinventory` - It exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fullfil an order.  I uses a domain consisting of a stock level and isbn.

* `bookrecommendation` - It consumes previous services and exposes and endpoint which recommends book names which are in stock.
