You can run a cURL command to test the whole application:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/books
[{"name":"Building Microservices"}

You can then navigate to http://localhost:9411 t to access the Jaeger UI.

The previous request generates a traces composed by 9 spans.

In the previous image, you can see that:

- Whenever a Micronaut HTTP client executes a new network request, it creates a new Span.
- Whenever a Micronaut Server receives a request, it creates a new Span.

The `stock.isbn` tags that we configured with `@SpanTag` are present.

Moreover, you can see the requests to `bookinventory` are done in paralell.
